* The CB file (ff_other_claim_on_liege.txt) is mostly a copy of the vanilla game CB. The only change is providing scripts a way to find the identity of the claimant.
* The Steam Workshop icon (broken_crown.png) is based on the Crown of Bavaria image from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Str%C3%B6hl-Regentenkronen-Fig._09.png. I used the Seashore image editor to "break" the crown into two pieces.
